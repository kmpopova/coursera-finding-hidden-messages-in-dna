"""
We say that a k-mer Pattern appears as a substring of Text with at most 
d  mismatches if there is some k-mer substring Pattern' of Text having d 
or fewer mismatches with Pattern, i.e., 

HammingDistance(Pattern, Pattern') â‰¤ d. 

Our observation that a DnaA box may appear with slight variations leads 
to the following generalization of the Pattern Matching Problem.

Approximate Pattern Matching Problem: Find all approximate occurrences 
of a pattern in a string.

Input: Strings Pattern and Text along with an integer d.
Output: All starting positions where Pattern appears as a substring of 
Text with at most d mismatches.

Code Challenge: Solve the Approximate Pattern Matching Problem.
